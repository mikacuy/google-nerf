These textures were not included in the Blend download as the Blend file is licensed under Creative Commons, which does not comply with many of the texture licenses. Hence the textures are downloaded separately and have different licenses, but can be considered a part of the "Suzanne's Revenge" Blend File available on blendswap.com created by Greg Zaal and Chris Kuhn.
